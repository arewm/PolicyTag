# PolicyTag

I created PolicyTag for CSC 705 (Operating Systems Security) at NCSU during the Spring 2017 semester. I wanted to determine whether individuals would be able to generate policies by combining automatically generated tags. The Django app is fully contained but the database needs to be populated before it can be used. If you would like the script I used to initially populate the database, please contact me.

You can find the final paper I wrote up [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/l6toizls4y1qj8h/policytag.pdf?dl=0). I also created a tutorial for the system that you can find below.
