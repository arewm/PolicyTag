# PolicyTag-django

This repository contains the code for the PolicyTag Django app. The app is fully contained, but the database
needs to be populated before the app can be used. If you would like the script I used to populate the databse,
please contact me.

PolicyTag was generated for CSC 705 at NCSU during the Spring 2017 semester.
