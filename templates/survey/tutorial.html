        <p>Google has developed Photos service as a way to automatically back up and sync photos and videos between all
            of your
            devices. When you upload media to Photos, is automatically processed and some tags are assigned using a
            classification algorithm.</p>

        <p>For the purpose of this survey, imagine that Google has developed a new feature for Photos that allows you to
            automatically sync media to specific destinations according to user-defined policies. This system leverages
            the
            automatically generated tags to define these sharing policies, control media export on a personal basis.</p>

        <p>The tags are divided into 5 general categories:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Photo type</dt>
            <dd> Generic description of the media (i.e. photo, video). This category also includes the labels describing
                content
                generated by Google's auto-editing functionality.
            </dd>
            <dt>Location</dt>
            <dd>Where the photo was taken. The location is described relative to Work and Home, two places that you can
                define
                for your Google profile
            </dd>
            <dt>Things</dt>
            <dd>Objects that Google has determined exist in your photos</dd>
            <dt>Photo properties</dt>
            <dd>Information associated with the photo by the camera that took the picture</dd>
            <dt>Temporal</dt>
            <dd>Describes the time that the photo was taken by type of day, date of creation, and time of creation</dd>
        </dl>
        Each of these tag categories also allows you to specify a custom tag for policies.
