        <p>Google has developed its Photos service as a way to automatically back up and sync media between
            multiple devices and the cloud. When you upload media to Photos, it is processed and some tags are
            automatically assigned
            using a classification algorithm.</p>

        <p>For the purpose of this survey, imagine that Google has developed a new feature for Photos that allows you to
            automatically sync media to specific destinations according to user-defined policies. This system leverages
            the automatically generated tags to define these sharing policies and control media export on a personal
            basis.</p>

        <p>The tags that can be used to specify policies are divided into 5 general categories:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Location</dt>
            <dd>Location information describes where the media was taken according to GPS data. These tags may be
                expressed relative to "Home" and "Work" as defined in your Google account details.
            </dd>
            <dt>Time</dt>
            <dd>Any time-related tags including the time/date/day of creation. These tags can either refer to discrete
                moments or ranges in time.
            </dd>
            <dt>Things</dt>
            <dd>These are objects and places that Google has identified in your media. These tags include types of
                animals, landmarks, and other common objects like statues and signs.
            </dd>
            <dt>Properties</dt>
            <dd>This information is defined by the camera that produced the media. It includes information like
                the make/model of the camera, whether a flash was used, and shutter speed.
            </dd>
            <dt>Type</dt>
            <dd>These tags contain generic descriptions of the media and can, for example, identify it as either a
                photo or a video. These tags can also describe how the media has been modified by Google's
                auto-editing
                features.
            </dd>

        <p>In order to create a policy,
            drag the desired tags from each category into the workspace. Some tags have been pre-defined in each
            category. You can also create your own tags in each category. After selecting tags for a specific policy,
            specify whether each action should be allowed or denied to that group of tags. If you are happy with the
            policy, click the green check mark to accept it. To reset the workspace, click on the red X.</p>


        <p>All accepted policies will show up at the bottom of the page.</p>

        <p>Once you have created all desired policies, click the button at the bottom of the page to continue to the
            next part.</p>

        {% if expert %}
            <p>In order to help you generate policies, we have provided some policy suggestions from security experts.
                You may load these into the workspace by clicking on them and customize the policy for your needs.</p>
