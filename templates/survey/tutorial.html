<p>Google has developed Photos service as a way to automatically back up and sync photos and videos between all of your
    devices. When you upload media to Photos, is automatically processed and some tags are assigned using a
    classification algorithm.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this survey, imagine that Google has developed a new feature for Photos that allows you to
    automatically sync media to specific destinations according to user-defined policies. This system leverages the
    automatically generated tags to define these sharing policies, control media export on a personal basis.</p>

<p>The tags are divided into 5 general categories:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>Photo type</dt>
    <dd> Generic description of the media (i.e. photo, video). This category also includes the labels describing content
        generated by Google's auto-editing functionality.
    </dd>
    <dt>Location</dt>
    <dd>Where the photo was taken. The location is described relative to Work and Home, two places that you can define
        for your Google profile
    </dd>
    <dt>Things</dt>
    <dd>Objects that Google has determined exist in your photos</dd>
    <dt>Photo properties</dt>
    <dd>Information associated with the by the camera that took the picture</dd>
    <dt>Temporal</dt>
    <dd>Describes the time that the photo was taken by type of day, date of creation, and time of creation</dd>
</dl>

<p>Each of these tag categories also allows you to specify a custom tag to filter on. In order to create a policy,
    simply drag the relevant tags to the workspace, specify whether each action should be allowed or denied, and click
    the green check mark.</p>

<p>All completed policies will show up in the bottom of the page.</p>

{% if expert %}
    <p>In order to help you generate policies, we have provided some policy suggestions from security experts. You may
        load these into the workspace by clicking on them and customize the policy for your needs.</p>
